Overview

This code exports a handler function that handles incoming voice calls made to a Twilio number. The function uses the Twilio Voice API to respond to the call and the Twilio Message API to send an SMS with the call log information.

Functionality

The handler function does the following:

Creates a new instance of a Twilio Voice Response object and uses the dial method to forward the call to the number specified in the FORWARDING_NUMBER context variable.

Gets an instance of the Twilio Client using the getTwilioClient method from the context object.

Sends an SMS using the create method of the client's messages object. The SMS contains information about the incoming call, including the caller's number (event.From) and the number being called (context.FORWARDING_NUMBER). The SMS is sent to the number specified in the LOG_NUMBER context variable and is sent from the Twilio number that received the call (event.To).

Returns the Twilio Voice Response object to Twilio, either with a success or error callback.

Usage

This code can be used as part of a Twilio function to handle incoming calls and log information about the call. The FORWARDING_NUMBER and LOG_NUMBER context variables should be set with the appropriate values for your use case.
